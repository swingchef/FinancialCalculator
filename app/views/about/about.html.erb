	<h1>About the Financial Calculator</h1>
	<p>
		The free debt reducer aims to help people to quickly pay off their debts without causing additional financial strain. The algorithm prioritizes debts by the amount of time it will take to pay them off and starts with the shortest debt. An additional 1% of the individual's monthly income is applied on top of the current (minimum) payment of that debt. When that debt is paid off, the payment amounts which were provided for that debt are now applied to the next debt (the next shortest). This process continues and has a beneficial "snowball" effect on payments; allowing users to pay off their debts quicker as the payments accumulate. The financial calculator offers an free, efficient option which helps to reduce debts but not change the person's lifestyle.
